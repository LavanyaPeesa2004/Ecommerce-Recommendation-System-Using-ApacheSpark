# 🛒 E-Commerce Recommendation System using Apache Spark & Databricks

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end **E-Commerce Recommendation System** built using **Apache Spark**, **Databricks**, and the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)**.

The system processes customer purchase data, performs large-scale analytics, generates personalized product recommendations using the **ALS (Alternating Least Squares)** algorithm, and visualizes business insights through an interactive **Databricks Dashboard**.

This project combines **Data Engineering, Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Structured Streaming, and Business Intelligence** into a unified workflow.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard provides interactive business insights including:

- Total Customers
- Total Products
- Total Orders
- Total Departments
- Top 10 Trending Products
- Purchases by Department
- Orders by Day of Week
- Orders by Hour of Day
- Purchase Activity Heatmap
- Top 5 Recommended Products (ALS)

---

## 🤖 Recommendation System

The recommendation engine uses the **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** algorithm from **Spark MLlib**.

### Input
- User ID
- Product ID
- Purchase Interaction Data

### Output
- Personalized Top-N Product Recommendations
- Predicted Preference Scores

---

## ⚡ Structured Streaming

A purchase producer simulates incoming customer purchases.

The streaming pipeline:

- Reads real-time purchase events
- Aggregates product purchases
- Updates trending products
- Stores results for analytics
- Feeds dashboard visualizations

## 📈 Business Insights

This project helps answer key business questions such as:

- Which products are purchased most frequently?
- Which departments generate the highest sales?
- At what time do customers place the most orders?
- Which day of the week has the highest purchasing activity?
- What products should be recommended to each customer?

---

## 🎯 Future Improvements

- Deploy recommendation engine as an API
- Integrate Kafka for real-time streaming
- Add user authentication
- Develop a recommendation web application
- Implement incremental model retraining
- Deploy on cloud platforms such as Azure or AWS
